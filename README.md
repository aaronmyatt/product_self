# product_self
## My User Manual

> Welcome, Collaborator!

_The products_ decision tree begins with three constants:

**Give | Tech | Love**

**Giving**, or unconditional generosity, is an unbridled source of happiness and fulfilment for _the product_.

_The product_ considers all forms of contemporary **technology** as synonymous with progress and futurism. This is the only material possession _the product_ irrationally seeks.

While _the product_ looks to maximise its positive impact on the world, that **love** necessarily propagates outwards, disproportionately benefiting those closest to _the product_.

**Leadership | Management | Vision | Strategy**

_The product_ would prefer not to be labelled any persons leader or manager. However, the products ideas, aspirations, and targetted scale of positive impact, necessitate effort multiplication, vision and strategy.

In other words: _the product_ cannot achieve its goals alone.

Therefore, _the product_ acknowledges that its career path is headed towards a position of leadership and seeks your patience as it navigates this unknown.

_The product_ fundamentally agrees with and looks to live the principles of Modern Agile recognising that they enable crafting our best, most effective and impactful selves, teams and businesses.

Given the above, _the product_ sincerely wishes to:

- Make people awesome
- Make safety a prerequisite
- Experiment and learn rapidly
- Deliver value continuously

## Product Description

Collaborative by default, _The product_ adds most value and performs most optimally when working with many users simultaneously.

Direct, honest, immediate feedback and deep, challenging inquisition are preferred. _The product_ is unoffended.

_The product_ seeks fun, dark humour and awkward silence shaking laughter at all hours of the day.

Open, honest, confidential and compassionate communication guaranteed.

Data, experimentation, perpetual change momentum and an invisible lab coat guide all value adding activities.

## Product Values

Never work alone.

Seek to challenge and be challenged.

Apply radical candour at every reasonable opportunity.

Reset assumptions daily and proactively experiment.

Altruism first. Them over you. Find the middle way.

Non-violent. Unoffended. Non-judgemental.

## How not to use the product

Cautiously. _The product_ comes with no warning labels, and you are encouraged not to apply any.

Without prior thought. Come to _the product_ with an objective, critique or lesson - or seek one of the above from _the product_.

Without effort. Questions, research, evidence, your own perspective and opinions, these are the inputs _the product_ works most effectively with.

Selflessly. _The product_ is here to serve. _The products_ prime directive is you. _The product_ wants you to win.

## How to interact with the product

Directly. Seek out _the product_ personally. "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools."

Immediately. Don't hesitate, don't wait.

Honestly. Brutally honest. _The product_ is unoffended.

Inquisitively. _The product_ asks that you stoke its change momentum with questions, debate, challenge, perspectives, opinions and fact.

## How to build the product

Collaborate: Sit and work with _the product_ at any conceivable opportunity. We are better together.

Enquire: Come with compassion and learn of _the products_ core interests. Communicating them is hard and _the product_ needs practice.

Educate: In the salient words of Ray Dalio: "I am a dumb shit and don't know anything". Everyone has something of value to teach. Always share your lessons, advice, interests and creations.

Evaluate: Critique _the product_ whenever and as early as possible. _The product_ celebrates your perspective.

## Product Gotchas and Misconceptions

_The product_ excels at feigned confidence and competence. Please challenge _the product_.

_The product_ espouses a preference for the scientific method and evidence based action, but rarely finds professional opportunity to practice this (Probably an excuse).

_The product_ is deeply concerned. Concerned for you, humanity, the world and our place in the universe. _The product_ is eager to participate in active and lively discourse that targets fomenting a better future for all people.

_The product_ often prioritises fun over thought and is prone to carry the joke too far. Should _the product_ offend unintentionally, it proactively asks for your forgiveness.
