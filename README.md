Welcome Collaborator

The products decision tree begins with three constants

Give | Tech | Love

Giving, or unconditional generosity, is an unbridled source of happiness and fulfilment for the product.

The product considers all forms of contemporary technology as synonymous with progress and futurism. This is the only material possession the product irrationally seeks.

While the product looks to maximise its positive impact on the world, that energy necessarily propagates outwards, disproportionately benefiting those closest to the product.

Leadership | Management | Vision | Strategy

The product loathes the idea of being labelled any persons leader or manager. However, the products ideas, aspirations, and scale of positive impact sought, necessitate effort multiplication, vision and strategy.

In other words: the product cannot achieve its goals alone.

Therefore, the product begrudgingly acknowledges that its career path is headed towards a position of leadership and seeks your patience as it navigates this unknown.

The product fundamentally agrees with and looks to live the principles of Modern Agile recognising that they support us in crafting our best, most effective and impactful selves, teams and businesses.

Given the above, the product sincerely wishes to:

- Make people awesome
- Make safety a prerequisite
- Experiment and learn rapidly
- Deliver value continuously
